		\begin{abstract}
		The abstract should not exceed 150 words. It should briefly summarize the content of the paper and address the following points. Objective: Briefly state the problem or issue addressed, in language accessible to a general scientific audience. Results: Provide a brief summary of the results and findings. Conclusions: Give brief concluding remarks on the study outcomes. Please notice that this is the template for SCIENCE MANUSCRIPTS. These are manuscripts with primary focus on reporting scientific results of relevance to the field of biomedical engineering. The material must be organized in a main manuscript body and a section entitled Supplementary Materials. The main manuscript body should be limited to 3,000 words and the material should be organized in the following sections (in the order shown here): Introduction, Results, Discussion, Conclusions, Materials and Methods. Authors can include in the main manuscript body up to 8 display items (i.e., figures and tables). In addition, the main manuscript body should include an abstract and up to 50 references. The references are not considered in the 3,000-word count. The abstract should be organized in subsections as shown here (i.e., Objective, Results, Conclusions). A significance statement should be included. The significance statement should be a short paragraph of no more than 30 words. Additional material should be included in the Supplementary Materials section of the manuscript. The Supplementary Materials section should either be organized in sections as per the main manuscript body (using up to 4,000 words) or it should be used to provide readers with a set of up to 10 additional display items (i.e. figures and tables).\\

\textcolor{violet}{\textbf{IMPACT STATEMENT}} The authors should include here a significance statement of no more than 30 words. The statement should summarize the main findings of the research work reported in the manuscript.

% \subsection{Equations}
% Number equations consecutively with equation numbers in parentheses flush with the right margin, as in (1). First use the equation editor to create the equation. Then select the “Equation” markup style. Press the tab key and write the equation number in parentheses. To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Use parentheses to avoid ambiguities in denominators. Punctuate equations when they are part of a sentence, as in

% \begin{equation}
% \begin{multlined}
% \int_{0}^{r_{2}} F(r,\varphi)dr d\varphi=[\sigma r_{2}/(2\mu_{0})]\\
% \int_{0}^{+\infty}exp(-\lambda |z_{j}-z_{i} |)\lambda^{-1} J_{1}(\lambda r_{2}) J_{0}(\lambda r_{1})d\lambda 
% \label{Eq:Example}
% \end{multlined}
% \end{equation}

% Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before the equation appears or immediately following. Italicize symbols (T might refer to temperature, but T is the unit tesla). Refer to “(1),” not “Eq. (1)” or “equation (1),” except at the beginning of a sentence: “Equation (1) is ... .”
% A general IEEE styleguide is available at \textit{http://www.ieee.org/web/publications/authors/transjnl/ \\index.html}

\section{Submitting Your Paper for Review}

{
\subsection{Uploading the Document}
All submissions must be uploaded via ScholarOne Manuscripts. Include full mailing addresses and e-mail addresses of all authors when uploading a manuscript. In addition, designate one author as the “corresponding author.” This is the author to whom proofs of the paper will be sent. Proofs are sent to the corresponding author only.

\subsection{Review Stage Using ScholarOne$^{\tiny\textregistered}$ Manuscripts}
Contributions to IEEE OJEMB must be submitted electronically on IEEE’s on-line manuscript submission and peer-review system, ScholarOne$^{\tiny\textregistered}$ Manuscripts at \textit{http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/embs-ieee}. First check if you have an existing account. If there is none, please create a new account. After logging in, go to your Author Center and click “Submit First Draft of a New Manuscript.” 
There are various steps to the submission process; you must complete all steps for a complete submission. At the end of each step you must click “Save and Continue”; just uploading the paper is not sufficient. After the last step, you should see a confirmation that the submission is complete. You should also receive an e-mail confirmation. For inquiries regarding the submission of your paper on ScholarOne Manuscripts, please contact oprs-support@ieee.org or call +1 732 465 5861.

\subsection{Final Stage Using ScholarOne Manuscripts}
Upon acceptance, you will receive an email with specific instructions regarding the submission of your final files.  To avoid any delays in publication, please be sure to follow these instructions.  Final submissions should include source files of your accepted manuscript, high quality graphic files, and a formatted pdf file.  If you have any questions regarding the final submission process, please contact the administrative contact for the journal. 
}

\section{Editorial Policy}
{
Do not publish “preliminary” data or results. The submitting author is responsible for obtaining agreement of all coauthors and any consent required from sponsors before submitting a paper. IEEE OJEMB strongly discourages courtesy authorship. It is the obligation of the authors to cite relevant prior work. IEEE OJEMB expects the main source of references be archival journal articles or books or thesis. Conference proceeding papers should be minimized since many are not undergoing rigorous peer reviews. 
At least two reviews are required for every paper submitted. Indecipherable English is a valid reason for rejection. There is a service available that will help you improve your English for a fee, and the link to that service can be found at \textit{http://www.ieee.org/web/publications/authors/transjnl/ index.html}. 
}

\section{Publication Principles}
{
	The two types of contents of that are published are; 1) peer-reviewed and 2) archival. IEEE OJEMB publishes scholarly articles of archival value as well as tutorial expositions and critical reviews of classical subjects and topics of current interest. 
	Authors should consider the following points:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Technical papers submitted for publication must advance the state of knowledge and must cite relevant prior work. 
		\item The length of a submitted paper should be commensurate with the importance, or appropriate to the complexity, of the work. 
		\item Authors must convince both peer reviewers and the editors of the scientific and technical merit of a paper; the standards of proof are higher when extraordinary or unexpected results are reported. 
		\item Because replication is required for scientific progress, papers submitted for publication must provide sufficient information to allow readers to perform similar experiments or calculations and use the reported results. Although not everything need be disclosed, a paper must contain new, useable, and fully described information. For example, a specimen’s chemical composition need not be reported if the main purpose of a paper is to introduce a new measurement technique. Authors should expect to be challenged by reviewers if the results are not supported by adequate data and critical details.
		\item Papers that describe ongoing work or announce the latest technical achievement, which are suitable for presentation at a professional conference, may not be appropriate for publication.
	\end{enumerate}
