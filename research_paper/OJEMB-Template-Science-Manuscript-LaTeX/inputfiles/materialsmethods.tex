\section{MATERIALS AND METHODS }	
Materials and methods can be expanded upon in the Supplementary Materials, if necessary.\\

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\\
Supplementary materials are encouraged and a short summary of the content of the Supplementary Materials section will appear before the acknowledgment. Please use the Supplementary Materials template. If you have Supplementary Materials, please use this section to direct readers to the Supplementary Materials and give them a brief overview of what they can expect to find in the Supplementary Materials. \\


ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\\
Use the singular heading even if you have many acknowledgments. Avoid expressions such as “One of us (S.B.A.) would like to thank ... .” Instead, write “F. A. Author thanks ... .” In most cases, sponsor and financial support acknowledgments are placed in the unnumbered footnote on the first page, not here.


\subsection{References}

See the end of this document for formats and examples of common references. For a complete discussion of references and their formats, see “The IEEE Style Manual,” available as a PDF link off the  \underline{\textit{Author Digital Toolbox}} main page.

\subsection{Footnotes}
Number footnotes separately in superscripts\footnote{It is recommended that footnotes be avoided (except for the unnumbered footnote with the receipt date on the first page). Instead, try to integrate the footnote information into the text.}.  Place the actual footnote at the bottom of the column in which it is cited; do not put footnotes in the reference list (endnotes). Use letters for table footnotes (see Table I).
