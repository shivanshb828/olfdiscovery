\section{RESULTS}
To use this template, type over sections of the template or cut and paste from another document. Highlight a section that you want to designate with a certain style, then select the appropriate name on the style menu. The style will adjust your fonts and line spacing. Do not change the font sizes or line spacing to squeeze more text into a limited number of pages. Use italics for emphasis; do not underline.
IEEE will do the final formatting of your paper. However, you should format your manuscript for submission to IEEE OJEMB for review and also for preparing for preprint that will be e-published several days after you upload the final version of an accepted manuscript.
